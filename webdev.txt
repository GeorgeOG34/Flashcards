What are the rules of XML?
<break>
1).Everytag must have a matching closing tag or be self<line>closing.<line>
2).All tags must be properly nested with no overlapping or intersecting tags, e.g. <b><i>web</i></b>
<line>3).Attribute values must be enclosed in quotes in the <line>opening tag.<line>
4). XML tags and attributes are case<line>sensitive<line>
5). the document must have a single root element
<break>
Talk about XML Validation
<break>
To validate an XML document it needs to be checked <line>against a "Document Type<line>Definition" or an "XML Schema Definition". The process <line>involves comparing the strucure and content of the xml <line>document to the rules defined in<line>the schema or DTD. It is useful as it helps to ensure<line>that the XML document adheres to a specific set of rules and helps avoid errors.
<break>
Talk about apache Virtual Hosts
<break>
A single server can present more than one website each with its own set of configurations specified in VirtualHost config blocks, selected by either name or ip address.
<break>
Give a Virtual Host Example:
<break>
<VirtualHost *:80> --matches requests on all ip addresses<line>
   ServerAdmin root@example.com<line>
   ServerName www.example.com<line>
   ServerAlias example.com<line>
   DocumentRoot /home/www/example<line>
   ErrorLog logs/example.com<line>
</VirtualHost>
<break>
Give apache access control require conditions
<break>
"Require all granted"<line>
"Require all denied"<line>
"Require host *name*" e.g."Require host kent.ac.uk"<line>
"Require ip *range*" e.g."Require ip 129.12"<line>
"Require not host *name*"<line>
alternatively you can use <if>...</if><line>
The above conditions can be grouped into one of three:<line> <RequireAll>, <RequireAny>, and <RequireNone><line>

<break>
Given the following CodeIgniter URL:<line> www.example.com/index.php/sports/tennis/rackets<line> Explain how it works
<break>
The url is split into "slugs" which are the following:<line>domain/index.php/controllername/function/argument1
<break>
Explain what a namespace is and how it is used in XML documents.
<break>
A namespace is a set of names in which all names are unique and<line>
it is used to avoid name clashes when an XML document uses e.g., two
schemas.
<break>
Explain what synchronous/asynchronous interations <line>mean in the context of AJAX
<break>
Synchonous: request is sent from client to sever and<line> then the client will pause execution and wait for a <line>reply
<line><line>
Asynchronous: Client sends a request and then <line>continues executing code.<line>
The reply is then treated as an event and will be <line>scheduledto handle it.
