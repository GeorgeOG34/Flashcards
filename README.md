# Flashcards
Electronic Flashcards program for my  modules, written in java.

This pretty much works out of the box, if you use my flashcards, which you can do by just cloning the whole repository.

You are able to make your own flashcards, but it can be a bit fiddly.
If you're creating flashcards for my modules then you'll need to make the following textfiles, in the same directory as the java file:
ComputerSystems.txt
IntroToAI.txt 
TheoryOfComputing.txt

## How to make a flashcard:
I have created a "markup language" type thing to help make the formating of flashcards easier.
You still save the flashcard questions and answers in the same textfile
please read syntax.txt
