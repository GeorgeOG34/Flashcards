# Flashcards
Electronic Flashcards program for my  modules, written in java.

This pretty much works out of the box, you just need to create your own flashcards.
If you're creating flashcards for my modules then you'll need to make the following textfiles, in the same directory as the java file:
ComputerSystems.txt
IntroToAI.txt 
TheoryOfComputing.txt

In those files, One line is one side of a flashcard. So on the first like put a question, second line answer to that question, third line repeat.
And that is pretty much it at the moment.
